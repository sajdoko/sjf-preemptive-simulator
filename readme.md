# SJF Preemptive Scheduler Simulator

This project is a simulation of the Shortest Job First (SJF) Preemptive scheduling algorithm. It allows you to add processes to a scheduler, and then simulate the execution of the processes using the SJF Preemptive algorithm. The scheduler prioritizes the execution of processes with the shortest burst time, and can interrupt a running process to give CPU time to another process with a shorter burst time.

## Features

- Add new process with its ID, arrival time, and burst time
- Run the scheduler and simulate the execution of the processes using the SJF Preemptive algorithm
- Display the process list and the result of the scheduling

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser
3. Use the form to add processes to the scheduler
4. Click the "Run Scheduler" button to simulate the execution of the processes

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap

## Acknowledgements

The project is based on the simulation of the SJF Preemptive scheduling algorithm. More information about the algorithm can be found in various Operating System textbooks.

## Note

this is a basic simulation of the algorithm, and it can be enhanced as per your requirements.
